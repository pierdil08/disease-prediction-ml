# Disease Progression Prediction using Clinical Data

This machine learning project analyzes patient clinical data to predict disease outcomes (e.g., cancer progression). It applies preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and classification techniques to generate predictive insights.

## üß™ Objective

- Clean and preprocess a biomedical dataset (e.g. TCGA or UCI)
- Analyze relationships between features and outcomes
- Apply:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest / SVM
  - Cross-validation + performance metrics (accuracy, AUC, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Load data in `notebook/analysis.ipynb`
2. Run preprocessing + model cells
3. Evaluate performance

## üß† Model Evaluation

- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Precision/recall
- Feature importances
